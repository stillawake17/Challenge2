Grid portfolio

# description

This is my professional portfolio as I progress as a web-developer. 
It's built in html and css, using css grid.

The top part looks ![portfolio shot 1](./images/Joanna%20Booth%20portfolio%201.png);
The work section looks like the following: ![portfolio shot 2](./images/Joanna%20Booth%20portfolio%202.png);

There are works to my link and each has an image and a title for each project. 
The images are clickable and go to new pages.
